# Hey again!

Been a while since I made a blog post. Been very busy prepping for college life! I'm a student at Clemson University! I'm really excited for everything I'm gonna learn here. There are alot of talented professors and staff here. I've already learned new skills and it's only the second week. Now that the bustle of college move-in week has calmed down, I can take a look at this portfolio again and make some updates, bug fixes, and other needed adjustments or changes. If you ever need to get in contact with me, check the card on the main page! Everything you need is listed there.

Have a great day!
