# Hi there!

I've been working on this portfolio for a while. I've gone through countless revisions of designs. I had complex 3D portfolios, then very simple, almost form like portfolios. I couldn't decide what direction I wanted to take. I'm fresh out of high-school, going to Clemson University for Computer Science. 

As you could imagine, I'm not career ready, not even close. I've had my fair-share of experiences in the programming world however. 

For example, I've taken first place for Computer Programming at the state level in SkillsUSA and TSA competitions, both in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, in 2024 I competed in Virtual Reality Visualization, which I also took first place in.

I qualified for nationals both years, but only went to the SkillsUSA nationals in 2023. I placed 13th overall for Computer Programming out of 100 competitors. Not too bad.
